I can help you set up multiple git-managed products in AWS Service Catalog. Based on the image you shared, I can see you're on the AWS Service Catalog page for creating multiple git-managed products.

To create multiple git-managed products with EC2 and S3 bucket resources, you'll need to:

1. First complete the form shown in your image by:
   - Entering the owner information
   - Completing any optional product details, support details, and tags
   - Specifying your external repository using AWS CodeStar Connections

2. Then create CloudFormation templates for your EC2 instance and S3 bucket in your git repository.

Here are sample CloudFormation templates for both resources:

For an EC2 instance:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'Simple EC2 instance template for Service Catalog'
Parameters:
  InstanceType:
    Type: String
    Default: t2.micro
    Description: EC2 instance type
  KeyName:
    Type: AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName
    Description: Name of an existing EC2 KeyPair
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: !Ref InstanceType
      KeyName: !Ref KeyName
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0  # Replace with appropriate AMI for your region
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: ServiceCatalogEC2
Outputs:
  InstanceId:
    Description: The Instance ID
    Value: !Ref MyEC2Instance
```

For an S3 bucket:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'Simple S3 bucket template for Service Catalog'
Parameters:
  BucketName:
    Type: String
    Description: Name for the S3 bucket
Resources:
  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Ref BucketName
      VersioningConfiguration:
        Status: Enabled
      Tags:
        - Key: Purpose
          Value: ServiceCatalogProduct
Outputs:
  BucketName:
    Description: Bucket Name
    Value: !Ref MyS3Bucket
```

Remember that based on the information in your image, all products must:
1. Use the external repository method
2. Have templates residing in the same repository
3. Share common details like owner, distributor, tags, and support details

After creating these templates in your git repository and connecting it via AWS CodeStar, you'll be able to manage and update these products through your version control system, making it easier to implement infrastructure as code practices.
